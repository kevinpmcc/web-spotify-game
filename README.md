This is a web-based version of Name That Tune. Spotify Game is its working title.

Players can search for an album or choose one from the default list. 

They then choose to hear a 1s, 3s or 5s snippet from a song on that album. They can listen as many times as they like.  

They then guess what song it was and are given points if they get it right.  

1s = 5pts  
3s = 3pts  
5s = 1pt
